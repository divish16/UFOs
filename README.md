# UFOs
## Overview of Analysis
### The purpose of this project was to create a dynamic web page which included organized tables of UFO sightings and the option to filter those results by date, city, state, country, and even shape. 
## Results
### With the new updates, users can use many different criteria to filter their search results. Users have the option to type in whatever date, city, state, country, shape, or any combination of the criteria and, at the click of the button, the table will show the correct information based on the input of the criteria.

## Summary of Analysis
### While the website is gorgeous and functional, one drawback that I noticed when I inspected the page was that the website had trouble resizing itself when switching between devices. When I clicked the "iPhone XR" button to view the page on, the full page did not fit the screen and I had to shift from side to side to view the results of the table. I recommend adjusting the code to so that the columns are formatted correctly across all devices. In order to become more interactive, I also recommend adding a button where people can input their own UFO sightings and include pictures along with a description, time, and location.
